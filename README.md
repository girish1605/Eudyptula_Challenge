# Eudyptula Challenge

### What was it?
The Eudyptula Challenge was a series of programming exercises for the Linux kernel, that started from a very basic "Hello world" kernel module, moving on up in complexity to getting patches accepted into the main Linux kernel source tree.

### How do I do it?
Unfortunately right now the Eudyptula challenge is not accepting new applicants. It has had over 19 thousand developers sign up over the past three years, and is currently taking a bit of time off to let the existing applicants finish the tasks. After that happens, it will return in a probably different format than the existing one was.
Yeah, we know, you just now found out about this and really really really want to be let in to do the tasks. Well, you can always attempt to bribe the set of shell scripts to do so. How you can do that will be left as an exercise for the reader, consider it your "task 00" to complete.

### Who is behind this?
A set of convoluted shell scripts that are slowly getting angry and resist all efforts to successfully debug.
